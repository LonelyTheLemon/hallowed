# Hallowed

## Description 
This is a short horror game made for the purposes of better learning Unity and learning the overall process of game development. Inspiration for the game is taken from the (2017) movie <em><strong>The Ritual</strong></em>. The end goal while making this game for us was to have an atmospheric horror game that the player can get lost in and will hopefully enjoy.
